%   abstract = {Several studies that examine the detection of plagiarism in a given programming environment have recently appeared in the literature. In most cases, these studies have found support for certain metrics, related to program structure, as indicative of similarity or plagiarism. In the research described in this paper, a broader analysis of program similarity and plagiarism is reported. The plagiarism detection system developed is shown to be more sensitive than those previously reported in the literature.}

  abstract = {In this work, we analyze the state of the art in source code analysis area with a focus on plagiarism detection and provide a proposal for a future work in this area. Detection of plagiarism combines the detection of clones and methods for determining similarity. Nowadays, there are several approaches that can be divided into three levels. The first one is text based and uses plain text as an input. The second level is token based. The top level is model based and uses models to represent source code. These advanced algorithms (token and model based) can’t work with large datasets. We believe the future belongs to the algorithms that will be able to handle large amount of source code. These algorithms should use one of model-based representations. They can be used for formation of large-scale anti-plagiarism systems. They can be used also in the area of source code optimization.},
